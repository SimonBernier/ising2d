# 2D Transverse Field Ising Model Analysis

Tensor network simulations of the two-dimensional transverse field Ising (2D-TFI) model using ITensor. This project explores equilibrium properties, quantum quenches, and entanglement dynamics in strongly correlated quantum systems.

## üî¨ Overview

This repository contains numerical implementations for studying quantum phase transitions and out-of-equilibrium dynamics in the 2D transverse field Ising model. The simulations use tensor network methods, specifically the Time-Dependent Variational Principle (TDVP), to efficiently simulate quantum many-body systems.

### Physical Model

The 2D transverse field Ising Hamiltonian:

```
H = -J Œ£ œÉÀ£·µ¢ œÉÀ£‚±º - Œ£ h·µ¢ œÉ·∂ª·µ¢
```

where J is the coupling strength, h·µ¢ is the local transverse field, and the sums run over nearest neighbors and all sites respectively.

## üìÇ Project Structure

### Core Modules

#### 1. **gap** - Equilibrium Properties
Calculates equilibrium properties of the 2D-TFI model, including:
- Energy gap between ground state and first excited state (critical point identification via gap scaling)
- Ground state energy
- Phase transition characterization

**Key Features:**
- Finite-size scaling analysis
- Critical exponent extraction
- Quantum phase transition mapping

---

#### 2. **vCrit** - Speed of Excitations
Determines the effective speed of light in the quantum system using entanglement dynamics.

**Method:**
- Introduces local perturbation to ground state wavefunction
- Evolves disturbed state using 4th order TDVP
- Tracks von Neumann entropy growth
- Extracts propagation velocity from entanglement spreading

**Physical Insight:** The speed at which entanglement propagates reveals fundamental information about the model's causal structure and emergent light cone.

---

#### 3. **uniform** - Homogeneous Quantum Quenches
Simulates uniform (homogeneous) quenches in the 2D-TFI model.

**Protocol:**
- Initial state: Ground state in gapped phase
- Quench: Instantaneous change to critical point
- Evolution: 4th order TDVP time evolution

**Observables:**
- Energy density evolution
- Spin correlations
- Von Neumann entanglement entropy dynamics

**Purpose:** Provides baseline for comparing with inhomogeneous quench dynamics.

#### 4. **movingFront** - Inhomogeneous Quenches ‚≠ê
The main focus of this project - simulates spatially inhomogeneous quenches with moving quench fronts.

**Key Features:**
- Quench front moves at constant velocity through the system
- Tracks instantaneous ground state during evolution
- 4th order TDVP for accurate time evolution
- Detailed tracking of non-equilibrium dynamics

**Observables:**
- Energy density distribution
- Spin correlation functions
- Von Neumann entanglement entropy
- Spatial structure of excitations

**Physical Motivation:** Studies how quantum information and excitations propagate when parameters change locally and spread through the system - relevant for understanding causality and out-of-equilibirum dynamics in quantum systems.
